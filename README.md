## ðŸ“˜ Description
RS_indexes is a Python library designed for geospatial analysis, allowing users to compute popular remote sensing (RS) indexes from satellite imagery. 
This package provides functions to calculate common indexes like NDVI, EVI, NDMI, NDWI, and NBR. 
It also provides functionality to load specific bands from satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2) using the rasterio library.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸŸ¢ Compute **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- ðŸŸ¢ Compute **EVI** (Enhanced Vegetation Index)
- ðŸŸ¢ Compute **NDMI** (Normalized Difference Moisture Index)
- ðŸŸ¢ Compute **NDWI** (Normalized Difference Water Index)
- ðŸŸ¢ Compute **NBR** (Normalized Burn Ratio)
- ðŸŸ¢ Load specific image bands from satellite files (like Sentinel-2) using rasterio

## ðŸ”§ Installation
To install **RS_indexes**, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
```bash
